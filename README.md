# Deploy-a-highly-available-website-using-terraform

An attractive feature of the cloud is that you can deploy applications in multiple data centers making them highly available and able to tolerate a high degree of failures. 
In this projec, I will deploy a secure and highly available website with Terraform on AWS using a three-tier architecture with private and public subnets. 
The web servers and Elastic Load Balancer will span multiple availability zones to achieve high availability.
